# LOBSTER

The **L**ightweight **O**pen **B**MW **S**oftware **T**raceability
**E**vidence **R**eport allows you to demonstrate software traceability
and requirements coverage, which is essential for meeting standards
such as ISO 26262.

This package contains the core LOBSTER tools: the basic API and tools
for generating reports.

## Tools

You can generate a report linking everything together with `lobster-report`.
The report is in JSON, but you can generate more readable versions of it
with additional tools:

* `lobster-online-report`: Preprocess a JSON report to contain github
  references instead of local file references
* `lobster-html-report`: Generate a HTML report
* `lobster-ci-report`: Generate a compiler-message like output, useful for CI
