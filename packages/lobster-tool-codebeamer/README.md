# LOBSTER

The **L**ightweight **O**pen **B**MW **S**oftware **T**raceability
**E**vidence **R**eport allows you to demonstrate software traceability
and requirements coverage, which is essential for meeting standards
such as ISO 26262.

This package contains a tool to interface with the proprietary
requirements management tool
[Codebeamer](https://intland.com/codebeamer).

## Tools

* `lobster-codebeamer`: Extrat requirements from codebeamer.

## Configuration
This tool works with an optional config file. In it you can declare which 
codebeamer fields should be used as 'refs' reference in the codebeamer file.

For the 'refs' reference in config file you can write:

```
{
"refs" : "cb-fieldname"
}
```
or
```
{
"refs" : ["cb-fieldname"]
}
```
or
```
{
"refs" : ["cb-fieldname1", "cb-fieldname2"]
}
```

Is it also possible to define the codebeamer token in this file:
```
{
"refs" : "cb-fieldname",
"token" : "your cb-token"
}
```

## Usage

There are two ways you can use this tool:

* Download all requirements mentioned by another lobster trace (this
  way you do not get a completeness check) (using `--import-tagged`)

* Download all requirements generated by a saved codebeamer query
  (using `--import-query`)

* Configure the 'refs' upstream reference (this argument is optional)
(using `--config`)

## Limitations

The key limitation is item text, which is currently not
imported. However we do plan to also import item text eventually.
