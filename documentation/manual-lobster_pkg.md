# lobster-pkg

**lobster-pkg** is a tool to extract tracing tags and activities from `.pkg` and
`.ta` files generated by the tool `ecu.test`.

The generated `.lobster` file can be used with the LOBSTER traceability framework.

For more details on `ecu.test` see https://www.tracetronic.com/products/ecu-test/.

Per default lobster-pkg will generate a .lobster file with version 5 without schema `lobster-act-trace`.
To generate a version 3 with schema `lobster-act-trace` add the command line argument `kind`,
for example:
```bash
> lobster-pkg --kind="act" ...
```

## Features

- Parses `.pkg` and `.ta` files (or directories containing them) to extract traceability information.
- Supports both standard tracing tags and those found in `TRACE-ANALYSIS` blocks.
- Outputs results in a format compatible with LOBSTER.
- Handles misplaced or malformed trace tags with clear warnings.
