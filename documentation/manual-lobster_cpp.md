# Tracing to C++ code

It is possible to skip errors generated by `clang-tidy`
by using the command line argument `skip-clang-errors`,
for example:
```bash
> lobster-cpp --skip-clang-errors="clang-diagnostic-error" ...
```

Here the error `clang-diagnostic-error` will be ignored.
You can also specify a list of errors to ignore.
