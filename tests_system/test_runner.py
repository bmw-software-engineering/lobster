    """Base class for system test runners.

    This class provides a common interface for running system tests on LOBSTER tools.
    The following features are provided:
    - The test runner can be configured with input files that are copied into the
      working directory before running the tool.
    - The test runner can be configured with output files that are expected to be
      generated by the tool. These files can be checked after the tool has been run.
    - The test runner can be configured with command line arguments that are passed
      to the tool when it is run.
    - The test runner can be configured with a working directory that is used as the
      current working directory when the tool is run.
    - The test runner can run the tool under test and return the result as a
      subprocess.CompletedProcess object.
