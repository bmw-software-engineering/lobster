# LOBSTER JSON Schemas

## Common

Each LOBSTER JSON file shares the following common structure:

```
{
    "data"      : LIST,
    "generator" : STRING,
    "schema"    : STRING,
    "version"   : INTEGER
}
```

* _data_ is the main content
* _generator_ is the name of the program that created the artefact
* _schema_ is one of the following:
  * lobster-req-trace for requirements traces
  * lobster-imp-trace for implementation traces
  * lobster-act-trace for activity traces
  * lobster-report for the tracing report
* _version_ is the version ID for this report; later version of LOBSTER
  may change data in an incompatible way and the version ID allows us
  to generate more useful error messages in this case

Some schemas may add additional top-level items, but these four are
always present.

### Source References

A SOURCE_REF is an object with varying forms. One field is always present:

```
{
   "kind" : REF_KIND,
}
```

Based on the value of *kind* this object takes different forms.

#### File references

File references look like this:

```
{
   "kind"   : "file",
   "file"   : STRING,
   "line"   : INTEGER or null,
   "column" : INTEGER or null
}
```

#### Github references

References to github look like this:

```
{
   "kind"     : "github",
   "gh_root"  : STRING,
   "gh_repo"  : STRING,
   "commit"   : STRING,
   "filename" : INTEGER,
   "line"     : INTEGER or null
}
```

The *gh_root* is the github instance, for example
`https://github.com`. The *gh_repo* is the combination of user and
repo, for example `bmw-software-engineering/trlc`. The *commit* is
either a SHA or a branch/tag name, for example `main`. Finally
*filename* and *line* has the usual meaning.

#### codebeamer references

References to the proprietary codebeamer tool look like this:

```
{
   "kind"     : "codebeamer",
   "cb_root"  : STRING,
   "tracker"  : INTEGER,
   "item"     : INTEGER,
   "version"  : INTEGER or null,
   "name"     : STRING
}
```

The *cb_root* refers to the root codebeamer URL (everything up to, but
excluding, the `/cb/`), *tracker* to the tracker that contains the
item, and *item* is the numeric id itself. The *version* if specified,
references a specific version, otherwise the reference is to the
HEAD. Finally *name* is the short human-readable name of the item.

Note: we are considering to retire this kind of reference as it is too
specific, and replace with a "online" reference that consists out of a
tool indicator (e.g. codebeamer) and a url. A design goal of LOBSTER
is after all that adding support for a new tool doesn't require a
change in LOBSTER itself.

#### Void references

A void reference can be used if an item cannot be given a proper
location or link, for whatever reason.

```
{
   "kind" : "void",
}
```

## Items

All items (requirements, implementation, and activities) share a few
basic properties.

### Version 1-2

Deprecated.

### Version 3

```
  "tag":         TRACING_TAG,
  "location":    SOURCE_REF,
  "name":        STRING,
  "refs":        LIST-OF-TRACING_TAG
  "just_up":     LIST-OF-STRING,
  "just_down":   LIST-OF-STRING,
  "just_global": LIST-OF-STRING
```

The `TRACING_TAG` is right now a string that matches this regex:

```regex
[a-z]+ .+
```

The first letter group is a namespace for the tag, e.g. `req` (for all
requirements) or e.g. `cpp` (for C++ code). The next letter group is
the actual tag name e.g. `example.requirement` or `12345`; and the
final optional group is a version. Some examples:

* `req example.requirement` TRLC requirement example.requirement
* `req 12345@42` codebeamer requirement 12345 at version 42
* `cpp kitten::foo` C++ function foo (in namespace kitten)

In the future we may make this an object.

The *name* is a more human readable name, which doesn't have to be
unique. For the names for the three examples above might be:

* `requirement` (just the trlc identifier)
* `requirement` (the actual title for item 12345 in cb)
* `foo` (just the function name)

The three justification lists *just_up*, *just_down*, and
*just_global* collect justification reasons why a link might be
missing. Generally you just use *just_up* since we link up; but in
some cases we might have to justify "from the top down". The global
justifications are both up and down, and should be used very
sparingly.

The *refs* is a list of `TRACING_TAG` referencing other items in
lobster this item should trace *up* to.

## Requirements

### Version 1-2

Deprecated.

### Version 3

Requirements are items, with the following additional fields:

```
{
   << the common item fields >>
   "framework" : STRING
   "kind"      : STRING
   "text"      : STRING or null
}
```

* *framework* is the data source, for example "codebeamer" or "TRLC".
* *kind* is a free text string describing what kind of requirement
  this is. For example "functional requirement".
* *text* is an optional copy or a summary of the requirement text.

### Version 4

As above, but adds one new field:

```
{
   << version 3 fields >>
   "status" : STRING or null
}
```

* *status* indicates the state of a requirement. This is used by some
  proprietary tools; and lobster can check that the status is one of
  the permitted ones.

## Implementation

### Version 1-2

Deprecated.

### Version 3

Implementation are items, with the following additional fields:

```
{
   << the common item fields >>
   "language" : STRING
   "kind"     : STRING
}
```

* *language* is a free text string indicating the implementation
  language. For example "Ada", "C++", or "Python".
* *kind* is a free text string describing the entity. For example
  "function", "method", "named number", "class".

## Activity

### Version 1-2

Deprecated.

### Version 3

Activity are items, with the following additional fields:

```
{
   << the common item fields >>
   "framework" : STRING
   "kind"      : STRING
   "status"    : STRING or null
}
```

* *framework* a free text string that describes where the activity
  takes place. For example "GTest", "SMTLIB Model", or "Hand-written
  analysis".
* *kind* is the type of activity. Generally, it is free text, but the
  following kinds have special meaning:

Test activities can (but are not required to) have another mapping for
"status" describing the test status. If set it can be one of the
following:

* *ok* if the test was run and no problems were found
* *fail* if the test was run and it failed
* *not run* if the test was not run for any reason

If the status is not explicitly set, then LOBSTER will assume it is
"ok". This makes sense because in a modern workflow you should have
pre-commit checks in your repo that block a commit where the tests
fail (hence we don't need to explicitly get the test status in LOBSTER
since it must always be OK).

## Report

The report schema is currently internal to LOBSTER.
