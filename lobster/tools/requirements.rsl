     The aspect itself is not testable. It is only testable in the context of a requirement.
     For example, an aspect may give details about a certain input, but it does not describe
     the related output.
     Nevertheless, system tests shall be linked to aspects, and each aspect shall be covered
     by system tests. These tests must always take the requirement into account, which uses
     the aspect.
     Using this type helps to make long requirements easier to read, and it is easier to
     develop tests for them.
