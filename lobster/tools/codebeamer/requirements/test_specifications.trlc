      The test shall check that the IDs (including their version) downloaded from
      codebeamer are exactly the same as written in the output.
      
      Example 1: verify that the tool does NOT truncate IDs. For example,
      it could download 10 IDs as expected, but those ID strings could be truncated by one digit each.
      
      Example 2: Verify that the tool does NOT duplicate IDs.

      Test steps:
      - download a set of items from a mock server
      - verify that the obtained IDs are the same as provided by the mock server
